![Taxi Data Mindmap](diagrams/taxi_data_mindmap.JPG)

**Basic idea**: 
- The cloud team hosts a small Kubernetes Cluster (hosted by Google Cloud) with basic monitoring services
- Microservices and other services can be deployed in the cluster (using configuration files)
- The participating teams exchange data to make the demonstration more interesting

## Teams
